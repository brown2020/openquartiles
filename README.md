## Deploy Your Own

You can deploy your own version of OpenQuartiles to Vercel with one click:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fbrown2020%2Fopenquartiles&env=OPENAI_API_KEY)

Remember to add your OpenAI API key to the environment variables in your Vercel project settings.


## CI

GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs lint, typecheck, tests, and production build.
`OPENAI_API_KEY` is wired via `${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}` on the build step only — never inlined.
Builds succeed without the secret (local fallback puzzle).

## Scripts

```bash
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run build
```
